Currently I'm a Cybersecurity Analyst in Houston, Texas. I carry out incident response and forensics work on ransomware cases and business email compromise cases. I also develop software programs and scripts mostly with Python.

Formerly, I was a neuroscientist. My work focused on how perception and patterns of neuronal activity are driven by interplay of external sensory input (primary visual cortex) versus internal previous experience (memories in the hippocampus). I studied these phenomena during wakefulness, falling asleep, REM-sleep, non-REM sleep and during LSD-induced hallucinatory states. 

I used to drive a fork-lift truck in a factory in Colne, Lancashire (United Kingdom). If you have ever been to Colne then you will know why I went back to school to study. Geographically, Houston is very far from Colne.
