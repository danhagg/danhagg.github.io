  title={LSD degrades hippocampal spatial representations and suppresses hippocampal-visual cortical interactions.},
  author={Domenico, Carli and Haggerty, Daniel and Mou, Xiang and Ji, Daoyun},
  abstract={Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) produces hallucinations, which are perceptions uncoupled from the external environment. How LSD alters neuronal activities in vivo that underlie abnormal perceptions is unknown. Here, we show that when rats run along a familiar track, hippocampal place cells under LSD reduce their firing rates, their directionality, and their interaction with visual cortical neurons. However, both hippocampal and visual cortical neurons temporarily increase firing rates during head-twitching, a behavioral signature of a hallucination-like state in rodents. When rats are immobile on the track, LSD enhances cortical firing synchrony in a state similar to the wakefulness-to-sleep transition, during which the hippocampal-cortical interaction remains dampened while hippocampal awake reactivation is maintained. Our results suggest that LSD suppresses hippocampal-cortical interactions during active behavior and during immobility, leading to internal hippocampal representations that are degraded and isolated from external sensory input. These effects may contribute to LSD-produced abnormal perceptions.},

  title={Hippocampal awake replay in fear memory retrieval.},
  author={Wu, Chun-Ting and Haggerty, Daniel and Kemere, Caleb and Ji, Daoyun},
  abstract={Hippocampal place cells are key to episodic memories. How these cells participate in memory retrieval remains unclear. After rats acquired a fear memory by receiving mild footshocks in a shock zone on a track, we analyzed place cells when the animals were placed on the track again and displayed an apparent memory retrieval behavior: avoidance of the shock zone. We found that place cells representing the shock zone were reactivated, despite the fact that the animals did not enter the shock zone. This reactivation occurred in ripple-associated awake replay of place cell sequences encoding the paths from the animal's current positions to the shock zone but not in place cell sequences within individual cycles of theta oscillation. The result reveals a specific place-cell pattern underlying inhibitory avoidance behavior and provides strong evidence for the involvement of awake replay in fear memory retrieval.},

  title={Activities of visual cortical and hippocampal neurons co-fluctuate in freely moving rats during spatial navigation.},
  author={Haggerty, Daniel and Ji, Daoyun},
  abstract={Visual cues exert a powerful control over hippocampal place cell activities that encode external spaces. The functional interaction of visual cortical neurons and hippocampal place cells during spatial navigation behavior has yet to be elucidated. Here we show that, like hippocampal place cells, many neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of freely moving rats selectively fire at specific locations as animals run repeatedly on a track. The V1 location-specific activity leads hippocampal place cell activity both spatially and temporally. The precise activities of individual V1 neurons fluctuate every time the animal travels through the track, in a correlated fashion with those of hippocampal place cells firing at overlapping locations. The results suggest the existence of visual cortical neurons that are functionally coupled with hippocampal place cells for spatial processing during natural behavior. These visual neurons may also participate in the formation and storage of hippocampal-dependent memories.},

  title={Initiation of sleep-dependent cortical-hippocampal correlations at wakefulness-sleep transition.},
  author={Haggerty, Daniel and Ji, Daoyun},
  abstract={Sleep is involved in memory consolidation. Current theories propose that sleep-dependent memory consolidation requires active communication between the hippocampus and neocortex. Indeed, it is known that neuronal activities in the hippocampus and various neocortical areas are correlated during slow-wave sleep. However, transitioning from wakefulness to slow-wave sleep is a gradual process. How the hippocampal-cortical correlation is established during the wakefulness-sleep transition is unknown. By examining local field potentials and multiunit activities in the rat hippocampus and visual cortex, we show that the wakefulness-sleep transition is characterized by sharp-wave ripple events in the hippocampus and high-voltage spike-wave events in the cortex, both of which are accompanied by highly synchronized multiunit activities in the corresponding area. Hippocampal ripple events occur earlier than the cortical high-voltage spike-wave events, and hippocampal ripple incidence is attenuated by the onset of cortical high-voltage spike waves. This attenuation leads to a temporary weak correlation in the hippocampal-cortical multiunit activities, which eventually evolves to a strong correlation as the brain enters slow-wave sleep. The results suggest that the hippocampal-cortical correlation is established through a concerted, two-step state change that first synchronizes the neuronal firing within each brain area and then couples the synchronized activities between the two regions.},

  title={Bidirectional modulation of hippocampal gamma (20-80Hz) frequency activity in vitro via alpha(α)- and beta(β)-adrenergic receptors (AR).},
  author={Haggerty, Daniel and Glykos, Vasily and Adams, Natalie and LeBeau, Fiona},
  abstract={Noradrenaline (NA) in the hippocampus plays an important role in memory function and has been shown to modulate different forms of synaptic plasticity. Oscillations in the gamma frequency (20–80 Hz) band in the hippocampus have also been proposed to play an important role in memory functions and, evidence from both in vitro and in vivo studies, has suggested this activity can be modulated by NA. However, the role of different NA receptor subtypes in the modulation of gamma frequency activity has not been fully elucidated. We have found that NA (30 μM) exerts a bidirectional control on the magnitude of kainate-evoked (50–200 nM) gamma frequency oscillations in the cornu Ammonis (CA3) region of the rat hippocampus in vitro via activation of different receptor subtypes. Activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors (α-AR) reduced the power of the gamma frequency oscillation. In contrast, activation of beta-adrenergic receptors (β-AR) caused an increase in the power of the gamma frequency oscillations. Using specific agonists and antagonists of AR receptor subtypes we demonstrated that these effects are mediated specifically via α1A-AR and β1-AR subtypes. NA activated both receptor subtypes, but the α1A-AR-mediated effect predominated, resulting in a reversible suppression of gamma frequency activity. These results suggest that NA is able to differentially modulate on-going gamma frequency oscillatory activity that could result in either increased or decreased information flow through the hippocampus.},
