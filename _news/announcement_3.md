Last night I ran a night-time trail race (half marathon) at a local state park. First time running a trail with a headlamp and made worse by a temperature of 35C/95F. It was a real grind, I dont't think I've ever felt that rough after a run before! <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7825665416">Here's my run on Strava.</a>
